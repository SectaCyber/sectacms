v0.21.0 release notes
=====================


New features
------------

* Upgraded to Wagtail 2.13

* Added new ``<head>`` and ``<body>`` tracking script settings. See
  :doc:`/how_to/add_tracking_scripts`.

* Added new ``sectacms.fields.MonospaceField`` for rendering text area fields
  in the Wagtail admin with monospace input and spell-checking disabled. This is
  used by the new tracking settings and is useful for implementing code-oriented
  fields.

* Improve developer tooling in new secta CMS sites by providing pre-configured
  ``.gitattribute`` and ``.editorconfig`` files.

* SEO features have been refactored into separate package ``wagtail-seo``. There
  should be no noticeable changes to your models, except for the addition of new
  properties which can be easily overridden and customized. See
  `wagtail-seo customization docs <https://docs.Secta.dev/wagtail-seo/customizing/index.html>`_.


Upgrade considerations
----------------------

* Existing projects will need to add ``wagtailseo,`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``
  (usually in ``settings/base.py``).

* **AMP support has been removed**. This means that your site will no longer
  serve automatically generated AMP pages after upgrading. If you had previously
  implemented custom AMP templates, or rely heavily on AMP pages, you may need
  to implement this functionality yourself. For any site what is not a large
  news publisher, we recommend removing AMP from your site, as it is no longer
  worth the maintenance burden. `See reasoning for this change
  <https://github.com/SectaCyber/wagtail-seo/issues/21>`_.

  * ``sectacms_tags.convert_to_amp`` has been removed.

  * ``sectacms.utils.convert_to_amp()`` has been removed.

  * You should remove any ``amp_template`` attributes from your models, as they
    are no longer used.

* ``sectacms/pages/base.html`` template has been modified. If you implement or
  extend your own ``base.html``, the following changes are notable:

  * template blocks: ``html_seo_base``, ``html_seo_extra``, ``og_seo_base``,
    ``og_seo_extra``, ``twitter_seo_base``, ``twitter_seo_extra`` have been
    replaced with ``{% include "wagtailseo/meta.html" %}``

  * template blocks: ``struct_seo_base``, ``struct_seo_extra`` have been
    replaced with ``{% include "wagtailseo/struct_data.html" %}``

* Properties and templates associated with SEO functionality have changed:

  * ``sectaArticlePage.get_author_name`` -> ``sectaArticlePage.seo_author``

  * ``sectaArticlePage.get_pub_date`` -> ``sectaArticlePage.seo_published_at``

  * ``sectaArticlePage.get_description`` -> ``sectaArticlePage.seo_description``

  * ``sectacms_tags.og_image`` -> ``page.seo_image_url``

  * ``sectacms_tags.structured_data_datetime`` has been removed.

* Some built-in blocks used in the Wagtail admin have been replaced:

  * ``sectacms.blocks.MultiSelectBlock`` -> ``wagtail.core.blocks.MultipleChoiceBlock``

  * ``sectacms.blocks.OpenHoursValue`` -> ``wagtailseo.blocks.OpenHoursValue``

  * ``sectacms.blocks.OpenHoursBlock`` -> ``wagtailseo.blocks.OpenHoursBlock``

  * ``sectacms.blocks.StructuredDataActionBlock`` -> ``wagtailseo.blocks.StructuredDataActionBlock``

* secta CMS now sets ``default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.AutoField'`` for
  its own concrete models. If you had previously manually specified a different
  ``DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`` Django setting, you may need to create a migration.

* You may need to find/replace
  ``sectacms.blocks.base_blocks.MultiSelectBlock`` with
  ``wagtail.core.blocks.MultipleChoiceBlock`` in any old migrations so that they
  may continue working.

* Follow `Wagtail 2.12 upgrade considerations <https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/releases/2.12.html#upgrade-considerations>`_
  and `Wagtail 2.13 upgrade considerations <https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/releases/2.13.html#upgrade-considerations>`_.

* You may need to run ``python manage.py makemigrations website`` and
  ``python manage.py migrate`` after upgrading.

* Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9
