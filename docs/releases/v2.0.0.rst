v2.0.0 release notes
====================


New features
------------

* Secta no longer pins the minor version of Wagtail.

* Support Wagtail 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2.


Upgrade considerations
----------------------

While there are no functional changes in Secta, there are many changes in Wagtail 4. Most Secta sites should not be impacted, however if your site implements custom functionality beyond what Secta provides, review the `Wagtail 4 release notes and upgrade considerations <https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/releases/4.0.html>`_.

If you are upgrading from an older version of Secta (0.x series) it is highly recommended to upgrade to 1.0 before attempting to upgrade to 2.0.

As always, be sure to make and apply migrations after upgrading:

.. code-block:: text

   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
